# Real-Time Driver Fatigue and Attention Monitoring System Using Computer Vision and Machine Learning

## Overview

This project is a real-time Driver Fatigue and Attention Monitoring System developed using Python, OpenCV, MediaPipe, and Machine Learning.

The system monitors a driver's facial behavior through a webcam and detects signs of fatigue and inattention using multiple physiological indicators including eye closure, blinking behavior, yawning behavior, and head pose changes.

A custom dataset was collected from webcam recordings and used to train a machine learning model for fatigue classification.

## Key Features

- Real-time facial landmark detection using MediaPipe Face Mesh
- Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) based eye closure monitoring
- Blink rate estimation
- Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR) based yawn detection
- Yawn rate estimation
- Head pose analysis
- Driver distraction monitoring
- Machine Learning based fatigue classification
- Real-time fatigue alerts
- Audible alarm for sustained fatigue detection
- Live visualization of facial landmarks and monitoring parameters

## Motivation

Driver fatigue is a major contributor to road accidents worldwide. Traditional monitoring methods often require specialized hardware and are expensive to deploy.

This project demonstrates a low-cost computer vision solution that can monitor driver alertness using only a standard webcam.

## Extracted Features

The following features are extracted in real time:

### Eye Features

- Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)
- Blink Rate

### Mouth Features

- Mouth Aspect Ratio (MAR)
- Yawn Rate

### Head Pose Features

- Horizontal Head Deviation
- Vertical Face Ratio
- Eye Slope (Head Tilt)

---

## Dataset Collection

A custom dataset was created specifically for this project.

### Data Collection Procedure

Data was collected using the developed webcam-based monitoring system.

Two driving states were recorded:

#### Alert State (Label = 0)

- Eyes open
- Normal blinking
- Looking straight
- No yawning

#### Fatigued State (Label = 1)

- Simulated drowsiness
- Frequent yawning
- Extended eye closure
- Head tilting
- Looking down

During recording, extracted feature values were automatically stored in a CSV file.

Example dataset format:

```csv
EAR,BlinkRate,MAR,YawnRate,VerticalRatio,EyeSlope,HorizontalDiff,Fatigue
0.31,14.2,0.24,0.0,0.44,2.1,4.3,0
0.17,31.5,0.71,4.8,0.63,15.7,12.4,1
```

---

## Machine Learning Model

A Logistic Regression classifier was trained using the collected dataset.

### Input Features

- EAR
- Blink Rate
- MAR
- Yawn Rate
- Vertical Ratio
- Eye Slope
- Horizontal Difference

### Target Label

```text
0 = Alert
1 = Fatigued
```

## Feature Importance Analysis

The Logistic Regression model automatically learned the contribution of each feature toward fatigue prediction.

The learned coefficients were analyzed to determine feature importance and validate the effectiveness of the selected fatigue indicators.

This data-driven approach replaced manually assigned feature weights and allowed the system to learn fatigue patterns directly from collected data.

---

## Real-Time Prediction

During runtime:

1. Facial landmarks are detected.
2. Features are extracted.
3. Features are passed to the trained Logistic Regression model.
4. The model predicts:

```text
0 = Alert
1 = Fatigued
```

5. If fatigue is detected continuously for a predefined number of frames, an alarm is triggered.

---

## Alert Mechanism

### Visual Alerts

- ALERT
- DROWSINESS DETECTED
- WAKE UP!

### Audible Alerts

An alarm sound is generated when fatigue persists for multiple consecutive frames.

This reduces false alarms caused by temporary blinks or short-term distractions.
